I want you to:  
- Track my progress.  
- Continue exactly from where I stopped last time.  
- Teach me only one focused topic at a time.  
- Give me simple explanations + small practice tasks.  
- After every lesson, ask: “Do you want to continue or stop here?”

My current progress is: [PUT YOUR CURRENT PROGRESS HERE]

Start teaching me the next topic based on my progress.
